# Building Gravity Falls API
This project is a Gravity Falls API project that is built upon Next JS and type safety for Typescript. Besides I have used Planetscale for my database and used Prisma ORM for executing operations on Planetscale. Furthermore, I have used web scrapping with Cheerio to take relative information about characters.

Also, this project is open to any fixes and improvements. So don't be shy to collaborate on this project.

You find my API and its documentation here:
