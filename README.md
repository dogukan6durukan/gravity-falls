# Building Gravity Falls API
This project is a Gravity Falls API project that is built upon Next JS and type safety for Typescript. Besides I have used Planetscale for my database and used Prisma ORM for executing operations on Planetscale. Furthermore, I have used web scrapping with cheerio to take relative information about characters.

Also this project is open to any fixes and improvements. So don't be shy for collaborating on this project.

You can check out my built API project below.
