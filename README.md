# Building Gravity Falls API
This project is Gravity Falls API project that is built upon Next JS and type safety for Typescript. Besides I have used Planetscale for my database and and used Prisma ORM for executing operations on Planetscale. Furthermore I have used web scrapping with cheerio for taking relative information about characters.
