# Gravity Falls API
This project is a Gravity Falls API project that is built upon Next JS and type safety for Typescript. Besides I have used Planetscale for my database and used Prisma ORM for executing operations on Planetscale. Furthermore, I have used web scrapping with Cheerio to take relative information about characters.

**Note: This project is not maintained anymore. It was used to test Next JS's pre-render(SSG) and API feature.**
